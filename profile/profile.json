The application utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to get real-time stock market data in JSON, utilizing the OkHttp library for managing HTTP requests. Then the application processes the data using the Jackson library to convert the JSON object into a Java object. This object is then processed and saved in the Postgres database. The entire application runs in a Docker container. Design patterns utilized in this application include the DAO pattern, the Repository pattern, and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Junit and Mockito were utilized to perform unit and integration testing to ensure the application is reliable and accurate.",

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering, from Toronto Metropolitan University in June 2023. I have taken courses including Object Oriented Programming, Database design, Algorithms and Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Software Design and Architecture. I have previous experience working as a software developer intern with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care, where I worked on the COVID case and contact management system using Apex, SOQL, Visual Force, and JavaScript (Equivalent to Java, MySQL, and ReactJS). What excites me about this field is the opportunity to transform innovative ideas into tangible, impactful solutions. I find satisfaction in continuous learning, embracing new technologies, and translating them into real-world applications. My main interests in the field of technology are fintech, blockchain technology, and game development. In my spare time, one of the things I enjoy doing is turning some of my ideas into fun projects that include full-stack web applications and bots. Some of these projects include a discord bot that manages the creation, organization, and brackets for Pok√©mon showdown tournaments among my friends. There's also a full-stack web application calisthenics progress tracker, that allows users to track their progress and make sure they're learning the skills in the correct order, which I'm currently working on."
