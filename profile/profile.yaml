summary: Hello, I'm Vincent Phung, I'm currently a junior software engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering, from Toronto Metropolitan University in June 2023. I have previous experience working as a software developer intern with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care. My main interests in the field of technology are fintech, blockchain technology, and game development. What excites me about this field is the opportunity to transform innovative ideas into tangible, impactful solutions. I find satisfaction in continuous learning, embracing new technologies, and translating them into real-world applications. In my spare time one of the things I enjoy doing is turning some of my ideas into fun projects that include full-stack web applications, scripts to automate tasks, and bots.
